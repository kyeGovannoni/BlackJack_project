# BlackJack_project -- Work in Progress, core elements are working however there are still some bugs and additional features that need to be added.

The purpose of this project was to try and recreate some of the elements from the game blackjack. 

Within the blackjack directory are the main game files, these files establish the elements needed for a playable game. 
 
The **strategy.py** file contains a WIP (work in progress) feature, with the goal of simulating a perfect playing strategy using the data inside the elements of this file.

The py files withing the **sims** folder are simulations that can be run, currently only count distribution is complete, new results can be generated from the notbook file.

The **unit_tests** directory contains the unit tests for the core game files and the distribution simulation. A temporary file is created for the purpose of the test, which is then deleted after.

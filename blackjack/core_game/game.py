    To initalise a game please include the player objects (dealer, player) and a game object (shuffler).
    
    The game handles the rules, the players, Split plays, the deck and the balances/payouts. 

    A clock is used to keep track of the players turn.
    Balance is used to deduct bets, allows for split plays and deactivate players from the next round who's balance is 0.
    The move logic is also validated through the Game class.
